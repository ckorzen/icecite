%We present \textit{Icecite}, a fully web-based and easy-to-use research paper management application. The aim of our application is to avoid the common, but usually bothersome tasks of a scientific research process. By offering the ability to manage, to read, to annotate, to share and to find scientific research papers easily, our application improves researchers daily working routine significantly.
