# Icecite

**Disclaimer**: This project is in an early alpha state and is still under development. So use it on your own risk :-)

## How to use

### Checkout

Checkout the project via

    git clone https://github.com/ckorzen/icecite.git --recursive

The --recursive flag is needed to update all submodules. 
If your version of git doesn't support this flag, you can do:

    git clone https://github.com/ckorzen/icecite.git
    cd icecite
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    
Once you have checked out the project you can request updates via
    
    git pull --recurse-submodules
    
### Build    

Build the project:
    
    cd icecite/pdf-parent
    mvn install

### Extracting text from PDF files

Extract text from PDF files:
    
    cd icecite/pdf-cli
    java -jar target/pdf-cli-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar [options] <input> [<output>]

This will parse the given input (which may be a pdf file or a directory of pdf 
files) and outputs the extraction results into the given output dir. If the 
output isn't given, the result will be printed to stdout.

The options are:

    --feature <feature>   The features to extract. Available: [characters,
                          figures, shapes, words, paragraphs, lines]
    --format <format>     The output format [tsv, xml, json].
    --prefix <prefix>     The prefix of files to consider on parsing the
                          input.
    --suffix <suffix>     The suffix of files to consider on parsing the
                          input.
    --recursive           Parse the input recursively.
    --visualize           Create visualization of the extracted features.
 
#### Example
 
If you wish to extract the words and text lines from a PDF file "foo.pdf", to 
have the result in an XML file and to create a visualization of the extracted 
features (a pdf where the extracted words and text lines are 
higlighted in different colors), use this command:
    
    java -jar target/pdf-cli-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar --feature words --feature lines --format xml --visualize foo.pdf
